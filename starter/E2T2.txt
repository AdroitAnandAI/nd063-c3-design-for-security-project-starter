# Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.

Ensure no security groups allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 22
Ensure no security groups allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 3389
Ensure CloudTrail logs are encrypted at rest using KMS CMKs

None of the 4 S3 buckets, either has default encryption enabled or deny bucket policy for put requests without server side encryption.
None of the 4 S3 buckets, have policies that require requests to use Secure Socket Layer (SSL).
None of the 4 S3 buckets, have logging enabled.
The Amazon EC2 instances are not managed by AWS Systems Manager.

access_logs.s3.enabled is false for Application Load Balancer (ALB). Logging not enabled.
On EC2 instance i-035490e9e8ac3b3f2, TCP & UDP port 20, 21, 22, 23, 67, 88, 111 which are associated with 'Telnet', FTP, SSH, DHCP, RPC etc are reachable from the internet. Attack surface is wide open.


# Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.

Encrypt S3 buckets
Encrypt EC2 volumes
Access for IP address of Security Groups revoked for port 22 and port 3389
Remove TCP & UDP access to the ports mentioned above.
