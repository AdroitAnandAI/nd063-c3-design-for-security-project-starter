# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.

Can enable only SSM access to instances. No need to allow SSH login.

# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.

It will not prevent unauthorized access. VPC private endpoints would only help VCP to S3 communication to stay within the AWS network.

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?

No. Only those data which would get written after enabling encryption will be encrypted.

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.

If cloud formation templates are applied again then the infrastructure will go to its previous state.
