# Identify tools that will allow you to do the following:

## Scan infrastructure as code templates

Both are suitable for IAC code scan
a) Terrascan
b) Regula

### Example vulnerability

b) Regula: IAM privileges given more than what is required.

##Scan AMIâ€™s or containers for OS vulnerabilities

Anchore
https://anchore.com/

Clair also can be used:
Its an open source vulnerability scanner and static analysis tool for container images


### Example vulnerability

Eg for Anchore: MEDIUM Vulnerability found in os package type (dpkg) - imagemagick-6-common (CVE-2008-3134 - Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in GraphicsMagick before 1.2.4 allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash, infinite loop, or memory consumption)

##Scan an AWS environment for cloud configuration vulnerabilities

Cloudmapper is an open-source tool that enables you to analyze and build an interactive visualization of assets, services, and other components in your AWS environment.

AWStealth is a security that tool teams use to discover the most privileged entities in the AWS cloud environment. The scan results show the users with excessive, risky, or sensitive permissions.


### Example vulnerability

Cloudmapper: Perform security audits, and easily share the analysis information. Also identifies publicly exposed resources

AWStealth: no MFA and no constrained condition in their permissions)
