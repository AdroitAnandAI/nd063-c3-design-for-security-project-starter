Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1

InstanceRolePolicy-C3 has given full control of S3. This practice is against the least control access best practice.

            Statement:
              - Effect: Allow
                Action: 's3:*'
                Resource: '*'

Also, the encryption and versioning is not enabled in S3.

# Poor practice 2

WebAppSG has opened ports 5000 and 8080 for HTTP communication. Ideally, port 443 should only be opened for HTTPs communication.

AppLoadBalancerSG and AttackInstanceSG has opened inbound and outbound communcation from all IPs (0.0.0.0/0) throwing open a wide attack surface.
